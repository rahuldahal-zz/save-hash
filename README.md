# The Context
I was reading an amazing article about [JavaScript Best Practices](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript). <br />
While going through it, there were some **points** that I found really useful and productive. <br />
I wanted to **save** those points, which inturn would make it easier for me to **reference** back in the future. <br />

## Birth of SaveHash
SaveHash makes it easier for readers to **save** *hash*(#) links. <br />
